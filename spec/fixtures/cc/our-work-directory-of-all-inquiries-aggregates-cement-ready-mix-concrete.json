Following the provisional\ndecision, the OFT held a six-week public consultation.\n\nThe OFT confirmed its decision to make a market investigation reference\non the 18 January 2012.\n\n## Reasons for reference\n\nThe OFT has referred the markets for aggregates, cement and ready-mix\nconcrete in Great Britain, to the Competition Commission for\ninvestigation, under section 131 of the Enterprise Act 2002. This is\nbecause the OFT has concerns that the industry displays a number of\nfeatures which may adversely affect competition. These include barriers\nto entry, vertical integration, homogeneous products, market\ntransparency and multi-market contacts which have the potential to\nreduce competition in settings with high levels of concentration.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the comments and evidence received\nduring the public consultation, the OFT considers that Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland are likely to be distinct geographic markets and that\nthe features identified are not present to the same degree in Northern\nIreland. Therefore the OFT has decided not to include Northern Ireland\nin the scope of the reference. However, we have not come to a view as to\nwhether Northern Ireland is a competitive market and may decide to look\nat this geographic market in more detail in the future.\n\n## Key documents\n\n* Download the [decision to make a Market Investigation\n  Reference](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/oft1358ref.pdf) (pdf 1.39Mb)\n* Download the [Terms of\n  Reference](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/Aggregates-TOR.pdf) (pdf 47kb)\n* Press release [OFT refers aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete\n  markets to the Competition\n  Commission](http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2012/02-12) (18\n  January 2012)\n* Download the\n  [Q&amp;As](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/AggregateQ+A.pdf) (January 2012) (pdf 155kb)\n* Download the [report on the market study and proposed decision to make\n  a market investigation\n  reference](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/oft1358.pdf) (pdf 968kb)\n* Press release [OFT proposes Competition Commission investigation of\n  aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete\n  markets](http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2011/90-11) (16\n  August 2011)\n* Download the\n  [Q&amp;As](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/Aggregates-QAs-2011.pdf) (August 2011) (pdf 147kb)\n\n   \n  \n  \n",
    "OFT/aggregates": "#  Aggregates \n\n\n\n**Start date:** 7 September 2010  \n**Completion date:** 18 January 2012\n\n\n\n## Summary of work\n\nIn September 2010 we launched a market study into the aggregates sector.\nThe aim was to look at competition in the market and at whether the\nmarket delivered good value for money. We also wanted to look at the\nplanning system for aggregates and at whether high barriers to entry and\nGovernment involvement influenced competitive conditions. Our study\nrevealed a range of concerns among stakeholders about how competition\noperates in this sector. While we heard views on planning and other\nissues, most concerns about competition related to the structure of the\naggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete markets. In particular,\nconcerns were expressed relating to the links between aggregates, cement\nand ready-mix concrete, and to the market strength and conduct of the\nfive vertically-integrated \\'majors\\'. For this reason in February 2011,\nwe extended the scope of the market study to include cement and\nready-mix concrete.\n\nIn August 2011, we published the findings of our market study and our\nprovisional decision to refer the markets for aggregates, cement and\nready-mix concrete to the Competition Commission (\\'the CC\\').  Our\nreport found that the industry displays a number of features which may\nadversely affect competition including:\n\n* **Barriers to entry:** both the aggregates and the cement markets\n  feature high barriers to entry in terms of the difficulty of obtaining\n  planning permission and physical capital requirements. Elements of the\n  planning system for aggregates in particular create substantial\n  barriers to entry by favouring incumbents over new entrants. In\n  addition, the information we have received suggests that fear of\n  retaliation and/or predation by the major companies may be deterring\n  entry into the cement and ready-mix concrete markets by independents\n  looking to either self-supply or expand their operations.\n* **Concentration:** all three product markets are highly concentrated\n  with five major players accounting, in Great Britain, for upwards of\n  90 per cent of the cement market, 75 per cent of aggregates sales and\n  circa 70 per cent of ready-mix concrete production. There is a\n  considerable drop in scale between the majors and the largest\n  independent in each market - there is no comparably large independent\n  producing any one of the three products. \n* **Vertical integration:** the major firms are integrated across\n  aggregates, ready-mix concrete and cement. We have received complaints\n  about vertically integrated firms refusing to supply or discriminating\n  against non-integrated competitors through their pricing, particularly\n  in relation to cement.\n* **Homogeneous products:** aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete\n  are, to a large extent, homogeneous products with little\n  differentiation by firm in terms of brand or quality.\n* **Transparency:** there is a high degree of transparency in relation\n  to all three products. Cross-trading between the major firms means\n  that they receive advance warning of each others\\' pricing intentions;\n  industry reports contain detailed information on market shares, sales\n  volumes and reserves; the planning system provides significant\n  transparency regarding capacity intentions; and there are industry\n  associations and working parties which may involve additional sharing\n  of information.\n* **Multi-market contacts:** although vertically integrated, the major\n  firms supply one another upstream and downstream (both for cement and\n  aggregates) to serve local markets. There are also a significant\n  number of joint-ventures and asset swaps in the three product markets.\n\nThese features have the potential to reduce competition in settings with\nhigh levels of concentration.\n\nWe also had evidence that competition may not be working well in these\nmarkets. In particular:\n\n* Difficulties faced by independent ready-mix concrete operators in\n  obtaining competitive quotes for cement from alternative suppliers,\n  and the importance independent operators place on relationships with\n  their existing suppliers.\n* A possible \\'squeeze\\' between the price of cement (which has risen in\n  recent years) and the price of ready-mix concrete (which has fallen,\n  then stabilised). We also had evidence that independents may be\n  charged higher prices for cement than the majors charge each other.\n* Pricing letters from the major firms coming out at similar times and\n  announcing similar price increases. Although these letters represent a\n  starting point for negotiations between customers and suppliers and do\n  not fix prices as such, these similarities may indicate that price\n  rivalry is not as intense as it could be.\n\nThe OFT therefore made its provisional decision to make a reference to\nthe CC of the supply of aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete in the\nUK, under section 131 of the Enterprise Act 2002. The OFT then held a\nsix-week public consultation.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the comments and evidence received\nduring the public consultation, the OFT continues to be of the view that\ncompetition may not be working well in Great Britain, but has decided\nnot to refer these markets in Northern Ireland because the features\nidentified are not present to the same degree. Therefore the OFT has\ndecided not to include Northern Ireland in the scope of the reference.\nHowever, we have not come to a view as to whether Northern Ireland is a\ncompetitive market and may decide to look at this geographic market in\nmore detail in the future.\n\n## Action\n\nThe OFT has referred the markets for aggregates, cement and ready-mix\nconcrete in Great Britain (excluding Northern Ireland), to the\nCompetition Commission for investigation, under section 131 of the\nEnterprise Act 2002.\n\n* Download the [OFT\\'s decision to make a Market Investigation\n  Reference](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/oft1358ref.pdf) (pdf 1.39Mb)\n\n\n\n## Related documents\n\n* Download the [OFT\\'s decision to make a Market Investigation\n  Reference](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/oft1358ref.pdf) (pdf 1.39Mb)\n* Download the [Terms of\n  Reference](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/Aggregates-TOR.pdf) (pdf 47kb)\n* Press release [OFT refers aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete\n  markets to the Competition\n  Commission](http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2012/02-12) (18\n  January 2012)\n* Download\n  the [Q&amp;As](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/AggregateQ+A.pdf) (January 2012) (pdf 155kb)\n* Download the [report on the market study and proposed decision to make\n  a market investigation\n  reference](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/oft1358.pdf) (pdf 968kb)\n* Press release [OFT proposes Competition Commission investigation of\n  aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete\n  markets](http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2011/90-11) (16\n  August 2011)\n* Download the\n  [Q&amp;As](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/Aggregates-QAs-2011.pdf) (August 2011) (pdf 147kb)\n\n## Background\n\n* Press release [OFT launches market study into\n  aggregates](http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2010/93-10) (7\n  September 2010)\n* Download the [market study launch\n  Q&amp;As](http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/market-studies/aggregates-QAs.pdf) (August 2010) (pdf 141kb)\n\n## Contacts\n\n**Team leader**\\: Cristina Luna-Esteban (0207 211 8208,\n[cristina.luna-esteban@oft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:cristina.Luna-Esteban@oft.gsi.gov.uk)) \n\n**Project director**\\: Mary Starks (0207 211 8307,\n[mary.starks@oft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:mary.starks@oft.gsi.gov.uk))  \n**Senior responsible officer**\\: Clive Maxwell (020 7211 8950,\n[clive.maxwell@oft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:clive.maxwell@oft.gsi.gov.uk))\n\n## Media enquiries\n\nAny media enquiries should be directed to a member of our [Press\nOffice](http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/).\n\n   \n  \n  \n"

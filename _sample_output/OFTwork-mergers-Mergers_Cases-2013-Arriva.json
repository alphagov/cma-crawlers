    Fields from finder-api/schema first. Filename is dasherized path
    of the first level page.
      
    e.g. if this is scraped from
     
       http://oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/Mergers_Cases/2013/Arriva
    
    then its filename is
    
       _sample_output/OFTwork-mergers-Mergers_Cases-2013-Arriva.json
       
    You can expect it to include the detail and attachments from these URLs:
      * http://oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/Mergers_Cases/ (detail from table row)
      * http://oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/Mergers_Cases/2013/Arriva#.UxmBTud_uMN (fragment ignored)

    Fields below are gleaned from various target specialist systems, URL given in comment
    block above each.
